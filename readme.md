# UoM-CS Quick Revision Sheets

This repo contains my own 'Quick Revision Sheets' of some subjects I am taking.

These sheets are used to quickly cover some key or hard knowledge points. This is written based on the materials of courses I attended and covers only the materials examinable in these AYs, respectively. For further information regarding their composition, building, and limitations, check:

I have now graduated from the Uni, and more sheets will be uploaded gradually as I have found them.

Hope this may be useful to you and wish you every good fortune in your quest for knowledge!
